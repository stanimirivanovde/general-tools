# general-tools
This is a repository that contains different tools I wrote through the years. Feel free to use them as you please.

## show-my-connections (Mac OS X / FreeBSD)
This is a tool to list the current established connections your computer has to a remote host. It is useful to see if you have suspicious connections going and to investigate them further. The tool can do a WHOIS lookup on the connections.
